# Dependency audit follow-up - 2026-06-02

Scope: Country Resilience Index round-4 P3-2 dependency hygiene follow-up, with round-5 R5-3 stale-count correction. This note records package-audit reachability only; no resilience scorer/runtime code was changed.

## Commands

- Baseline before lockfile refresh:
  - `npm audit --omit=dev --json`: 0 critical, 0 high, 36 moderate.
  - `npm audit --json`: 0 critical, 9 high, 44 moderate.
- After lockfile refresh, rerun on 2026-06-02 with `node v26.0.0` and `npm 11.12.1` in this worktree:
  - Root `npm audit --omit=dev --json`: 0 critical, 0 high, 36 moderate.
  - Root `npm audit --json`: 0 critical, 0 high, 43 moderate.
  - `blog-site/` `npm audit --omit=dev --json`: 0 vulnerabilities.

Counting caveat: npm audit totals are metadata counts for vulnerable package nodes in the resolved dependency graph, not unique CVE/GHSA advisory counts. npm 11's current graph counting reports 36 production moderate nodes and 43 all-dependency moderate nodes here; earlier 18/20 post-refresh totals in this note were stale.

## Updated dev/build chain

The high advisories were dev/build-only and were removed with a package-lock-only refresh inside existing semver ranges:

- `vite-plugin-pwa`: 1.2.0 -> 1.3.0.
- `workbox-build` and Workbox packages: 7.4.0 -> 7.4.1.
- Babel Workbox build chain, including `@babel/plugin-transform-modules-systemjs`: 7.29.7.
- `ajv`: 8.20.0.
- `fast-uri`: 3.1.2.
- Workbox `brace-expansion`: 5.0.6.
- `tmp`: 0.2.7.
- npm 10 lockfile peer entries for `utf-8-validate`: 5.0.10.

This clears the prior all-dependency high advisories in the PWA/Workbox/AJV/Babel chain and the `exceljs -> tmp` high advisory. `exceljs` remains at 4.4.0, which is the latest published version at the time of this audit.

## Remaining production-runtime advisories

Production audit remains high/critical clean. Remaining production advisories are moderate and are in these reachable dependency families:

- `@anthropic-ai/sdk`: direct dependency; npm reports no compatible fix available.
- Clerk wallet stack: `@clerk/clerk-js` through Solana wallet adapters, `@solana/web3.js`, `viem`, `ws`, `jayson`, and `uuid`.
- Mapping/vector stack: `deck.gl`, `@deck.gl/geo-layers`, `maplibre-gl`, `pbf`, `resolve-protobuf-schema`, and `protocol-buffers-schema`.
- Convex stack: `@dodopayments/convex`, `convex`, and `ws`.
- Telegram proxy/address parser stack: `telegram`, `socks`, and `ip-address`.
- Shared websocket/identifier transitives: `ws`, `uuid`, `isows`, and `isomorphic-ws`.

These were not force-upgraded because npm does not offer high/critical production fixes in the current compatible graph, and forcing broad wallet/map/runtime upgrades would be outside this P3 dependency-hygiene scope.

## Remaining dev/build-only advisories

The all-dependency audit now has only moderate dev/build advisories on top of the production-runtime moderate set:

- `vite`, `vite-plugin-pwa`, `vitest`, and `@vitest/mocker` through `postcss <8.5.10`. The root `vite@6.4.2` range currently resolves `postcss@8.5.8`; npm reports no compatible fix without broader Vite/PostCSS movement.
- `convex-test` through the same Convex/ws chain reported in production.
- `exceljs -> uuid@8.3.2`. `exceljs@4.4.0` depends on `uuid@^8.3.0`; no newer ExcelJS release is available, and replacing the spreadsheet library is outside this narrow follow-up.

No force upgrade was applied because the remaining issues are moderate and would require broader package replacement or runtime/toolchain changes.

## Round 6 R6-3 wallet-chain check - 2026-06-03

Scope: Country Resilience Index round-6 R6-3 moderate dependency advisory debt in the Clerk/Solana wallet chain.

Current audit results in the `origin/main` worktree at `e1739afc4758e664d13aae54e1b457c12e5eb075`:

- `npm audit --omit=dev --json`: 0 critical, 0 high, 12 moderate.
- `npm audit --json`: 0 critical, 0 high, 13 moderate.

These counts are lower than the earlier round-4 refresh because this section is a fresh point-in-time audit of the current `origin/main` tree, not a reduction produced by this R6-3 pass. npm's current report no longer includes the earlier Anthropic SDK, mapping/vector, Convex, Telegram, or shared websocket advisory families in this lockfile; the remaining production findings are the Clerk wallet chain.

The production findings are the Clerk wallet chain:

- `@clerk/clerk-js@6.13.0` directly pins `@solana/wallet-adapter-base@0.9.27`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-react@0.15.39`, and `@solana/wallet-standard@1.1.4`.
- The Solana wallet packages peer on `@solana/web3.js@^1.98.0`; the resolved and latest stable release is `@solana/web3.js@1.98.4`.
- `@solana/web3.js@1.98.4` depends on `jayson@^4.1.1`; the resolved and latest release is `jayson@4.3.0`.
- `jayson@4.3.0` depends on `uuid@^8.3.2`, which remains inside the `uuid <11.1.1` advisory range.

The all-dependency-only extra finding is `exceljs@4.4.0 -> uuid@^8.3.0`. `exceljs@4.4.0` is still the latest published release.

A targeted package-lock-only update attempt was run for the implicated packages:

`npm update @clerk/clerk-js @solana/wallet-adapter-base @solana/wallet-adapter-react @solana/wallet-standard @solana/wallet-standard-wallet-adapter @solana/wallet-standard-wallet-adapter-base @solana/wallet-standard-wallet-adapter-react @solana/web3.js jayson uuid exceljs --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`

npm reported the graph was up to date and still had 13 moderate findings. It only removed optional peer lockfile entries for `utf-8-validate`, which did not reduce R6-3, so that incidental lockfile churn was not kept.

No override was added. Forcing `uuid@>=11.1.1` under `jayson` or `exceljs` would violate their declared `uuid@^8` ranges, and forcing `@solana/web3.js@2.x` or `3.x` would violate the current wallet adapter peer range and would be a broader wallet integration migration. Clerk snapshot/canary builds newer than `6.13.0` still pin the same Solana wallet packages.

Recommended tracking action: keep R6-3 open as upstream dependency debt and retest when one of these stable releases exists: Clerk removes or updates the Solana wallet pins, Solana wallet adapters accept a patched `@solana/web3.js` line, `@solana/web3.js` 1.x stops depending on `jayson -> uuid@8`, or `jayson`/`exceljs` publish compatible `uuid@>=11.1.1` support.
